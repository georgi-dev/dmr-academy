# <i class="pe pe-check"></i> Regular License
The most popular license, the Regular License allows the use of __Volta__ in <strong>one single end product, which end users are not charged to access or use</strong>.  You can use Volta directly on your own website or, if youâ€™re a freelancer, you can create the end product for one client whose end users will use the product free of charge, your personal admin dashboard for example. You can charge your client to produce the single end product. In production, you will use the minified version of the source files. __Distribution of source files is not permitted.__

# <i class="pe pe-plus"></i> Extended License
The Extended License is suited for Developers and it allows use of __Volta__ in <strong>one single end product, which you or one client may sell to end users</strong> (charge end users to access or use the end product). __Distribution of source files is not permitted.__

##### <i class="pe pe-info"></i> Additional Information
By purchasing an Extended License, you do not get a multi-use, multi-domain, multi-client or developer license. The Extended License is still limited to a single end product, but you can re-sell that product, such as a theme or paid application.

##### <i class="pe pe-download"></i> Theme Integration
You can use __Volta__ in your ThemeForest item if you purchase one Extended License for that purpose. This means you will need to purchase __one Extended License for every single ThemeForest item you upload__.
